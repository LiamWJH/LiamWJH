## About me
I am a student that is interested in making projects in **python** ranging from small scale to medium,
I mainly use python for my projects and prefer python even though i have some understandings about Java C and Javascript and but more,
I take coding seriously and even so i do coding for my hobby and happiness, as at the end of the day thats how I came to coding,
I like a good bug once in a while as i enjoy the steps and feeling when debugging code, after all that i feel happy.

## Main project [Craplang](https://github.com/LiamWJH/Craplang)

A simple scripting language that is [turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) from feature driven development

### Technical acheivements
In this project No external libraries were used for parsing and lexing for the core interpreter, rather it was made with pure python.
Also in this project all the architecture of code was made by myself with several trys from previous projects like [Crapibara](https://github.com/LiamWJH/Crapibara)
  
### Tools and more
For this project git and github was used to maintain code for branches for each feature and libraries made.
Also the testcases or in other words examples were created almost for every important feature
We also used the pyinstaller module to make single file executable for windows

### Open source
For the open source maintainment, almost all the base documents were done myself and formatted by me.
Also the release section was also managed by myself.

### Language and framework
Used python for the whole code(Except for few .crap code for test cases)
Used argparse to parse commands when it becomes an exe
Used shlex for basic splitting

### Process
Grew consistenly from 100 lines to almost 400 lines of code
