## Introduction
I am a commited student on using the python language, i enjoy making small tools that are helpful for me to use or just for the fun of making it and see it work,
even from the dawn of my coding journey i have dreamed of making a programming language. As of now such dreams turned from impossible ones to possible, tangibly done
progress and history. I love progress learning new things and coding itself.


## Main project (As of now)
My main project as of now is [Bluewater](https:\\www.github.com/LiamWJH/Bluewater-lisp), it is a simple lisp dialect that supports all the basic features and bit more
i have wrote this project only with vanilla python and argparse for command line interface. It has been a rapid growth as since the inititive commit.
If you want to commit to this rapid growing lisp interpreter please make a issue on the good first issue or just make a PR right away.
