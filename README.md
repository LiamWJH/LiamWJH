> I scream at the language runtime more than my code.

## Introduction
I am a student that uses **Rust**, **Python**. I have made handful of interpreters and compilers from 2024 ~ 2025, i love making systems and documenting the code and finishing on big projects. I would like to contribute to any project i can and i would like **you** to contribute to mine! Contact me on discord.


## Main project (As of now)
My main project as of now is [Butter language](https:\\www.github.com/LiamWJH/Butterlang), it is a growing compiler that supports all the basic features a language would need and bit more.
I have wrote this project only with vanilla Rust without any external parsing/lexing dependencies. Whats better is that we transpile to the C language then we rely on the gcc compiler for compiling.
